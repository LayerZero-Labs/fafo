//! Core definitions and constants for QMDB.
//!
//! This module contains fundamental constants and helper functions used throughout
//! the QMDB codebase, including:
//! - Cache and buffer sizes
//! - Cryptographic parameters
//! - Entry and shard configurations
//! - File system paths
//! - Merkle tree parameters
//! - Operation codes
//! - Compaction settings
//!
//! # Architecture
//! The constants are organized into several categories:
//!
//! ## Storage Configuration
//! - Shard counts and sizes
//! - Buffer dimensions
//! - File paths and segments
//!
//! ## Security Parameters
//! - Encryption settings (nonce, tag sizes)
//! - Entry validation constants
//! - Version tracking
//!
//! ## Performance Tuning
//! - Cache configurations
//! - Batch processing limits
//! - Compaction thresholds
//!
//! ## Merkle Tree Structure
//! - Tree levels and dimensions
//! - Twig parameters
//! - Node organization
//!
//! # Performance Considerations
//! - Buffer sizes affect memory usage and I/O patterns
//! - Shard counts impact parallelism and contention
//! - Compaction parameters influence storage efficiency
//!
//! # Security Notes
//! - Cryptographic parameters follow industry standards
//! - Version tracking prevents replay attacks
//! - Entry validation ensures data integrity
