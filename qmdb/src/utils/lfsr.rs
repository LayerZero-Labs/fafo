//! Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) implementation.
//!
//! This module provides a Galois LFSR implementation based on the paper:
//! "Efficient Shift Registers, LFSR Counters, and Long Pseudo-Random Sequence Generators"
//! from the University of Otago (https://www.physics.otago.ac.nz/reports/electronics/ETR2012-1.pdf).
//!
//! The implementation supports bit counts from 5 to 63 and provides maximum-length
//! sequences for each bit count using carefully chosen tap positions.

// Based on: https://www.physics.otago.ac.nz/reports/electronics/ETR2012-1.pdf

/// A Galois Linear Feedback Shift Register.
///
/// This implementation uses a Galois configuration, which is more efficient
/// than a Fibonacci configuration. The LFSR generates pseudo-random sequences
/// with maximum period (2^n - 1) for the supported bit counts.
